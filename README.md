# simple_calc
Simple calculator, made to practice basic python.

# Usage
To use this calculator in its current state, you'll first have to open a terminal window, and then navigate to the directory you clone this repo to.
After that, you'll run the calculator with the command `python simple_calc.py`
The dialogue prompts will walk you through continued usage, simple as they may be, but you'll start by making a selection for a math function. These can be add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
Then, if there was no previous result, you'll provide the first, then second number to do math on.
The calculator will run that function, print the result, then offer to continue, or clear the previous result.
To clear the result, use the keyword clear.
To exit the calculator, use the keyword end, when you would normall make a selection.
